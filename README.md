# TF2 Wiki Dark Mode Extension

This Chrome extension applies a dark mode theme to the Team Fortress 2 Official Wiki (wiki.teamfortress.com), providing a more comfortable browsing experience, especially in low-light environments.

## Features

*   **Global Dark Theme:** Transforms the overall look of the TF2 Wiki into a dark theme.
*   **Content Area Dark Mode:** The main content area (`#content` and `#bodyContent`) is inverted using CSS filters to ensure all elements, including images, adapt to the dark theme while maintaining readability.
*   **Header Dark Mode:** The top header bar (`#mw-head`) is styled with a dark background and adjusted text colors.
*   **Sidebar Dark Mode:** The left-hand navigation sidebar (`#mw-panel`) is given a dark background with white text for improved visibility.
*   **Popup/Overlay Dark Mode:** Various popup widgets and overlays (`.oo-ui-popupWidget-popup`, `.oo-ui-clippableElement-clippable.oo-ui-popupWidget-body`) are styled to match the dark theme.
*   **Navigation Tabs Dark Mode:** The main navigation tabs (`#left-navigation`, `#right-navigation`) are also styled for dark mode.
*   **Footer Dark Mode:** The page footer (`#footer`) is integrated into the dark theme.
*   **Adjusted Padding:** The main content area has a slight padding for better visual separation.
