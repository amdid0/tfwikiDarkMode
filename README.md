6.  **Enable Extension:** The extension should now appear in your list of extensions. Ensure it is enabled.

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, simply navigate to the Team Fortress 2 Official Wiki (wiki.teamfortress.com). The dark mode theme will be automatically applied.

## Customization

You can customize the dark mode by editing the `styles.css` file within the extension's directory. After making changes, go back to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon on this extension's card to apply the updates.
I don't recommend it. There's a high chance it will break.
